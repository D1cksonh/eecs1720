- I watched some tutorial by the coding trian to learn how to make a browser extention (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bL9VOMT65ahNEri9uqLWfS)
- I somewhat learned how to use .json and .js to make a broswer extention through the tutorials
- I used VScode to write most of my code and learned how to use it
- I tried to replicate 'the coding train' google chrome extention examples with some success to get a better understanding on how to make a chrome extention--> i have linked the examples i made in the github folder label by the date of this log
