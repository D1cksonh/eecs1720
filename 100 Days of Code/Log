- I watched some tutorial by the coding trian to learn how to make a browser extention
- I somewhat learned how to use .json and .js to make a broswer extention through the tutorials
- I used VScode to write most of my code and learned how to use it
- I tried to replicate 'the coding train' google chrome extention examples with some success to get a better understanding on how to make a chrome extention--> i have linked the examples i made in the github folder label by the date of this log
- I spend most of my day trying to understand how to make a chrome extention but it was somewhat complicated

Jan 20th 2022
- I have made a popup extention on google chrome 
- I have spend a part of my day trying to get a popup extention on chrome to work
- I have followed "the coding train" tutorials in trying to make a popup extention on google chrome
- I tried using whatever begginer HTML knowledge i have and tried to make a website inside of the popup page
- The HTML file contains a a <h1>, <h2>, <p>, bolded text and some images to just learn to use HTML more
- I was trying today to try to get a p5.js sketch file into the popup window but it didn't work as i thought it would, mainly because i'm unsure how to link a javascript file to the popup window
- Tomorrow im going to try to get a simple javascript progam into the popup window by creating a website in the extention tab, perhaps that may work 
- What im also going to do tomorrow is try to learn some javascript coding on p5.js to get myself familiar on how to use p5.js
