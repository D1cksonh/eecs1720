- I added a repo called "eecs1720" for this course
- Started the log
- Change some of the code from the professor so the circle has a different fill and stroke color

Jan 19th 2022
- I watched some tutorial by the coding trian to learn how to make a browser extention
- I somewhat learned how to use .json and .js to make a broswer extention through the tutorials
- I used VScode to write most of my code and learned how to use it
- I tried to replicate 'the coding train' google chrome extention examples with some success to get a better understanding on how to make a chrome extention--> i have linked the examples i made in the github folder label by the date of this log
- I spend most of my day trying to understand how to make a chrome extention but it was somewhat complicated

Jan 20th 2022
- I have made a popup extention on google chrome 
- I have spend a part of my day trying to get a popup extention on chrome to work
- I have followed "the coding train" tutorials in trying to make a popup extention on google chrome
- I tried using whatever begginer HTML knowledge i have and tried to make a website inside of the popup page
- The HTML file contains a a <h1>, <h2>, <p>, bolded text and some images to just learn to use HTML more
- I was trying today to try to get a p5.js sketch file into the popup window but it didn't work as i thought it would, mainly because i'm unsure how to link a javascript file to the popup window
- Tomorrow im going to try to get a simple javascript progam into the popup window by creating a website in the extention tab, perhaps that may work 
- What im also going to do tomorrow is try to learn some javascript coding on p5.js to get myself familiar on how to use p5.js

Jan 22nd 2022
- I created a popup window extention tab that allows you to run p5.js code
- The p5.js code is running by importing a p5.js libary called "p5.vscode", this allowed me to type p5.js code into VScode
- I then connected a HTML file to the sketch.js file through the HTML and therefore i can run the p5.js code
- I created also a program that changes all images on a site to images that are inside the folder
- I linked random images in the folder and made a extention that makes all of the images on a page change into the images into the folder

Jan 25th 2022
- I tried to use p5.js to code a simple game into p5.js
- The game is simpy you (as a ball) has to move through the openings between the red rectanges
- The game isnt quite working as intended (as there is no hitbox to when the player hits a wall), i manage to get some of the concept working as making stuff move
- I just learn how to use p5.js a little as it may be useful to know a little when doing some projects, also i wanted to experiment using p5.js 
- I did also tried to import this code into an google extention using the p5.js libary on VScode, the code ran well and i was able to use the demo game i made and play it in my extention
- What i also did was made anothere extension. The 6th extension is when you open a new tab, the new tab will become the html doccument linked to the .json file

Jan 26th 2022
- I have made an exntension page that it opens links in the user's browser, I have putted the links on a HTML page and when the extension is open, the user can click onto the link and it will create a new tab that is the link on the HTML
- I have experiemented with the "target=..." to see which one works and have found that writing _blank and nothing works in the target

Jan 30th 2022
- I worked on the first lab project in making the google extension 
- I will try to use most of the information i learned from the "100 days of code" to make an extension
